## Mechatronic Engineer

Iâ€™m from Ecuador and I particularly enjoy learning languages and frameworks such as React. At this time of my career, Iâ€™m looking for a first opportunity as a professional full stack developer. For this reason, I spend a lot of time developing projects from scratch. I also enjoy electronic design because of its possibilities,  particularly the ability to combine both worlds and create amazing things.
