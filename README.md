### Hi there :wave:

I'm Javier from Ecuador, and I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React, as well at the moment I'm looking for my first opportunity as a professional full stack developer but expend a lot of time develop projects from scratch. I also enjoy electronic design since if you combine both worlds it's possible create amazing things.
