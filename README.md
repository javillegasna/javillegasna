### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,  I'm Javier Villegas
#### I'm Mechatronic Engineer and Full Stack Developer

Iâ€™m really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React, as well at the moment I'm looking for my first opportunity as a professional full stack developer. Therefore I'm expending a lot of time develop projects from scratch. I also enjoy electronic design since you combine both worlds, it's possible creates amazing things.
